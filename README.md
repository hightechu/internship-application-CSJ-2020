### About the 30 Second Pitch Video

Create a 30 second pitch video that answers the following question: `What can you bring to the HighTechU team?`

You can film your 30 second video with a smartphone, a computer webcam, or a camera.

Alternatively, you can create your 30 second video with https://biteable.com/, https://www.powtoon.com/home/, https://www.animaker.com/, or another method.

Afterwards you'll need to share your 30 second pitch video by uploading to a file sharing service (i.e. Dropbox, Google Drive) or video sharing website (i.e. YouTube, Vimeo) of your choice, and **sharing the link** in your application form.

Your video must be titled `firstName - LastName - HighTechU - 30 Second Pitch Video`, where `firstName` and `lastName` is replaced by your first & last name.


> **Important**: For privacy reasons, please set your sharing settings for these files to `unlisted` or `restricted`

### About the One-page Website

Create a one-page website that will contain your application.

We have provided a base template for your website. You may create your own website from scratch, but it must follow the same structure as the base template. You can add files as appropriate.

#### Base Structure

* `internship-application`
    * .gitignore
    * README.md
    * index.html
    * `files`
    * `css`
        * main.css
    * `img`
        * logo.png
    * `js`
        * main.js

The base template includes Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) and Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/). Bootstrap helps with the bulk of the CSS (and JS if you choose to use certain Bootstrap Components). Font Awesome helps by providing an icon font. This means you can include icons in your website that act like a font (you can apply CSS).

#### Requirements

Your one-page website must include the following:

* Your name and an introduction blurb (no more than 500 characters)
* Your written answers (no more than 500 characters each) to the following questions:
  1. Why would you like to work for HighTechU?
  2. How many hours a week are you available to work between November 30, 2020 and February 28, 2021?
  3. What do you hope to get out of the internship?
  4. What do you expect to be your biggest challenge during the internship?
  5. If you aren't successful with your application, what steps will you take to help ensure you are successful in the future?
  6. What is your favourite thing about programming?


    Optional:
    - Link to a personal portfolio/website
    - Link(s) to personal projects
      - Link to Source Code Repository
      - Live Deploy Link (if possible)
    - Your 30 second pitch video (Embedded)

> **Important**: Your written answers cannot be more than 500 characters for each question. Use this online tool to verify your character count before submitting. http://www.charactercountonline.com/

## **Get Started**

To start working on your internship application, you'll need a local copy of the application template files. This can be achieved in two different ways depending on your setup.

Change into your working directory
```bash
cd your/working/directory
```

2. **Create a repository folder**

```
>   **Important**: `firstName` and `lastName` will be replaced by your first & last name.
